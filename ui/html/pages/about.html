<h1>About</h1>

<p>GoSnipIt is a simple web application built with Go that allows you to store snippets of text. You can either create a
    snippet and
    have it expire after a certain amount of time, or create a snippet that never expires. The main purpose of this
    project was to learn and familiarize myself with Go and its concepts. </p>
